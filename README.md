## About the Conservative Mode
* With the Conservative Mode enabled, Windows ***only allows Microsoft OneDrive, Google Chrome and other executables located in C:\Windows, C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86) running***, which can greatly help you prevent running external malware or unwanted software.

* Please type BEINDANGER in start menu and run the command to disable the Conservative Mode if you are ***really prepared to take potential risks*** to do the following things:
	1. Install, update or uninstall non-Microsoft Store Apps
	2. Run the blocked executables
    
* ***Never forget to type BESAFE in start menu and run the command to enable the Conservative Mode to bring your PC back to safety ! ! !***



## Cautions
* ***PerfectWindows.bat is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 .***
* ***PerfectWindows.bat is not compatible with Windows XP and Windows Vista.***
* PerfectWindows.bat disables your desktop, taskbar and toolbar in order to reduce clutter and encourage you to make full use of start menu. Try to get used to these changes, because these changes actually can make Windows tidy and boost your multi-tasking efficiency. Don't worry about those existing desktop files, they are still in the desktop folder.
* PerfectWindows.bat disables power options in start menu in order to encourage you to sleep or hibernate your PC by closing the lid or pressing the power button, which is really beneficial for your working efficiency and your PC hardware health. 
* PerfectWindows.bat disables the DELETE key in order to prevent you from permanently deleting your precious files mistakenly.
* PerfectWindows.bat disables Cortana and Microsoft OneDrive by default because most people consider these services redundant. If you rely on Cortana or Microsoft OneDrive, please create "cortana.txt" or "onedrive.txt" beside PerfectWindows.bat respectively and then run PerfectWindows.bat as administrator again. 
* PerfectWindows.bat inevitably locks many PC settings in order to make your Windows experience perfect. Because of that, you may see notifications like "Please contact your system administrator".
